PRIVACY POLICY FOR WHATDOG (ALPHA)

Hello there, 



I'm going to keep this short and simple and to the point.

Camera Permissions are required show the app which dog is that. 

File permissions are required to save intermediate files for processing and providing an inference.



NO DATA from WHATDOG APP will be saved on our servers. I assure you all of your data is yours, and none of it will be accessed or used in any sort of tailored or personalized experience. 



I assure you, no data is being sent from your device to any server so nothing to worry about the permissions.

All Inference occurs In-App/On-Device and hence the large size of app.
